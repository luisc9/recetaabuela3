Assignment 2: Creating a UI for visualizing food recipes

In the FastAPI assignment, you were asked to create an API to retrieve a single random
recipe containing a given ingredient. Here we propose you to create a UI where you can
specify the ingredient and how many recipes containing this ingredient you want to
retrieve. The UI should also include a button that, once pressed, it will retrieve the recipes
and show them in table, including the ingredients in one column and the recipes in the
other column.
Remember you can use the dataset available at:
